## Frappe Learning
Frappe Learning is an easy-to-use learning system that helps you bring structure to your content.

### Motivation
In 2021, we were looking for a Learning Management System to launch [Mon.School](https://mon.school) for FOSS United. We checked out Moodle, but it didnâ€™t feel right. The forms were unnecessarily lengthy and the UI was confusing. It shouldn't be this hard to create a course right? So I started making a learning system for Mon.School which soon became a product in itself. The aim is to have a simple platform that anyone can use to launch a course of their own and make knowledge sharing easier.

### Key Features

- **Structured Learning**: Design a course with a 3-level hierarchy, where your courses have chapters and you can group your lessons within these chapters. This ensures that the context of the lesson is set by the chapter.

- **Live Classes**: Group learners into batches based on courses and duration. You can then create Zoom live class for these batches right from the app. Learners get to see the list of live classes they have to take as a part of this batch.

- **Quizzes and Assignments**: Create quizzes where questions can have single-choice, multiple-choice options, or can be open ended. Instructors can also add assignments which learners can submit as PDF's or Documents.

- **Getting Certified**: Once a learner has completed the course or batch, you can grant them a certificate. The app provides an inbuilt certificate template. You can use this or else create a template of your own and use that instead.
